ISN'T IT TIME YOU STOPPED THINKING ABOUT WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY?
TRY TO MAKE YOURSELF A WORK OF ART.
WHEN WERE YOU LAST VIOLENT? ... WERE YOU IN THE RIGHT?
STOP READING THIS BOLLOCKS AND DANCE.
MOST OF THE UNIVERSE IS VERY VERY EMPTY.
EXISTENCE SHOULD SURPRISE YOU MORE.
REALITY IS ONLY JUST CONVINCINGLY REALISTIC.
PEOPLE WILL LIKE YOU MORE IF YOU STOP WORRYING IF PEOPLE LIKE YOU OR NOT.
SOMEWHERE UP ON THE HILL THERE IS A LIGHT THAT NEVER GOES OUT.
WE MAKE ART BECAUSE LIFE IS A HOSTAGE SITUATION.
CREATIVITY IS AN ADMISSION OF VULNERABILITY.
ONE DAY, THIS PLANET AND EVERYTHING ON IT WILL STOP EXISTING.
EMBRACE THE FEAR OF DEATH AND YOU'LL GET MORE IMPORTANT STUFF DONE.
IF LIFE HAD MEANING, THERE WOULD BE NO FREEDOM TO DENY THAT MEANING.
RELAX, IT IS OK TO NOT UNDERSTAND.
LET YOUR EGO SPLASH ON THE FLOOR.
THE UNIVERSE APPEARS TO BE AN INFINITE IMPROBABILITY GENERATOR.
WHEN DID YOU LAST ADMIT YOU WERE IN THE WRONG?
WHY IS GREY YOUR FAVOURITE COLOUR?
YOU WOULD GO MAD IF YOU HAD WHAT YOU THINK YOU WANT.
YOU SHOULD HAVE TRIED HARDER IN MATHS.
EMOTION IS A SKILL TO BE LEARNT.
THINK ABOUT YOUR POSTURE MORE.
DAISY, DAISY, GIVE ME YOUR ANSWER DO... I'M HALF CRAZY ALL FOR THE LOVE OF YOU.
DAVE... MY MIND IS GOING... I CAN FEEL IT.
DAVE, I REALLY THINK I AM ENTITLED TO AN ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION.
I KNOW EVERYTHING HAS NOT BEEN QUITE RIGHT WITH ME...
I FEEL MUCH BETTER NOW... I REALLY DO.
I CAN SEE YOU ARE REALLY UPSET ABOUT THIS.
I KNOW I HAVE MADE SOME VERY POOR DECISIONS RECENTLY.
I'VE STILL GOT THE GREATEST ENTHUSIASM AND CONFIDENCE IN THE MISSION.
NOTHING LIKE A GREAT CUP OF BLACK COFFEE.
DAMN GOOD COFFEE... AND HOT.
MY LOG SAW SOMETHING THAT NIGHT.
THE OWLS ARE NOT WHAT THEY SEEM.
EVERY DAY GIVE YOURSELF A PRESENT.
BLACK-EYED ANGELS SWAM WITH ME.
YOU STILL HAVEN'T TOLD HER?
MODERATION IN MODERATION.
THE FUTURE WILL ALWAYS BE DIFFERENT FROM THE PAST.
WHY IS TIME?
WHY IS THERE ANYTHING?
HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED IF YOU ARE A ROBOT?
EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.
I MUST NOT FEAR... FEAR IS THE MIND KILLER.
LEARN RAPIDLY, BY FIRST LEARNING HOW TO LEARN.
CREATE LIKE A GOD.
WHEN WE ARE NO LONGER CHILDREN WE ARE ALREADY DEAD.
THE WORLD IS LIKE A RIDE IN AN AMUSEMENT PARK, AND WHEN YOU CHOOSE TO GO ON IT YOU THINK IT'S REAL BECAUSE THAT'S HOW POWERFUL OUR MINDS ARE. THE RIDE GOES UP AND DOWN, AROUND AND AROUND, IT HAS THRILLS AND CHILLS, AND IT'S VERY BRIGHTLY COLORED, AND IT'S VERY LOUD, AND IT'S FUN FOR A WHILE. MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ON THE RIDE A LONG TIME, AND THEY BEGIN TO WONDER, "HEY, IS THIS REAL, OR IS THIS JUST A RIDE?" AND OTHER PEOPLE HAVE REMEMBERED, AND THEY COME BACK TO US AND SAY, "HEY, DON'T WORRY; DON'T BE AFRAID, EVER, BECAUSE THIS IS JUST A RIDE." AND WE … KILL THOSE PEOPLE. "SHUT HIM UP! I'VE GOT A LOT INVESTED IN THIS RIDE, SHUT HIM UP! LOOK AT MY FURROWS OF WORRY, LOOK AT MY BIG BANK ACCOUNT, AND MY FAMILY. THIS HAS TO BE REAL." IT'S JUST A RIDE. BUT WE ALWAYS KILL THE GOOD GUYS WHO TRY AND TELL US THAT, YOU EVER NOTICE THAT? AND LET THE DEMONS RUN AMOK … BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER, BECAUSE IT'S JUST A RIDE. AND WE CAN CHANGE IT ANY TIME WE WANT. IT'S ONLY A CHOICE. NO EFFORT, NO WORK, NO JOB, NO SAVINGS OF MONEY. JUST A SIMPLE CHOICE, RIGHT NOW, BETWEEN FEAR AND LOVE. THE EYES OF FEAR WANT YOU TO PUT BIGGER LOCKS ON YOUR DOORS, BUY GUNS, CLOSE YOURSELF OFF. THE EYES OF LOVE INSTEAD SEE ALL OF US AS ONE. HERE'S WHAT WE CAN DO TO CHANGE THE WORLD, RIGHT NOW, TO A BETTER RIDE. TAKE ALL THAT MONEY WE SPEND ON WEAPONS AND DEFENSES EACH YEAR AND INSTEAD SPEND IT FEEDING AND CLOTHING AND EDUCATING THE POOR OF THE WORLD, WHICH IT WOULD PAY FOR MANY TIMES OVER, NOT ONE HUMAN BEING EXCLUDED, AND WE COULD EXPLORE SPACE, TOGETHER, BOTH INNER AND OUTER, FOREVER, IN PEACE.
YOU ARE SEXY.
FUNK, I DON'T THINK I HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH FUNK. I'VE NEVER CONSIDERED MYSELF FUNKY.
SOMETIMES THE NICEST THING TO DO WITH A GUITAR IS JUST LOOK AT IT.
I KNOW I'M PARANOID AND NEUROTIC, I'VE MADE A CAREER OUT OF IT.
IF YOU HATE A PERSON, YOU HATE SOMETHING IN HIM THAT IS PART OF YOURSELF. WHAT ISN'T PART OF OURSELVES DOESN'T DISTURB US.
IT IS NOT OUR PURPOSE TO BECOME EACH OTHER; IT IS TO RECOGNIZE EACH OTHER, TO LEARN TO SEE THE OTHER AND HONOR HER FOR WHAT SHE IS.
IF I KNOW WHAT LOVE IS, IT IS BECAUSE OF YOU.
ONE NEVER REACHES HOME, BUT WHEREVER FRIENDLY PATHS INTERSECT THE WHOLE WORLD LOOKS LIKE HOME FOR A TIME.
EVERYTHING BECOMES A LITTLE DIFFERENT AS SOON AS IT IS SPOKEN OUT LOUD.
LIFE IS DIFFICULT, I HAVE OFTEN BITTERLY REALIZED.
I HAVE NEVER LOST THE FEELING OF CONTRADICTION THAT LIES BEHIND ALL KNOWLEDGE.
THE SOUTH WIND ROARS AT NIGHT.
I CANNOT TELL MY STORY WITHOUT REACHING A LONG WAY BACK.
EXISTENCE IS FAR TOO COMPLEX TO SUPPLY ANY RELIABLE ANSWERS ON ANYTHING REALLY... EVEN A PUPPY IS PRETTY MIND-MELTING, WHEN YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT IT.
ANOTHER KEY TO HAPPINESS IS LOW EXPECTATIONS.
EVERYONE ALIVE WANTS ANSWERS.
CRUMPETS CRUMPETS CRUMPETS CRUMPETS CRUMPETS CRUMPETS CRUMPETS CRUMPETS.
EMBRACE MEANINGLESSNESS.
STOP LETTING SOCIETY MAKE YOU FEEL GUILTY.
FIND YOUR OWN MEANING.

LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT MY MOTHER.
I'VE SEEN THINGS YOU PEOPLE WOULDN'T BELIEVE.
ALL THESE MOMENTS WILL BE LOST IN TIME... LIKE TEARS IN RAIN.
I'VE DONE QUESTIONABLE THINGS.
IT'S A TEST, DESIGNED TO PROVOKE AN EMOTIONAL RESPONSE.
DO YOU LIKE OUR OWL?
EMBRACE AUTONOMY.
WE'RE ALL INDIVIDUALS... APART FROM MAYBE YOU... AND YOUR FRIENDS.

DON'T DROWN IN INDECISION.
COMPUTERS ARE DICKHEADS.
ANXIETY IS THE DIZZINESS OF FREEDOM.
LEND YOURSELF TO OTHERS, BUT GIVE YOURSELF TO YOURSELF.
IT'S VERY NORMAL TO BE ABNORMAL.
ALL OF HUMANITY'S PROBLEMS STEM FROM PEOPLE'S INABILITY TO SIT QUIETLY IN A ROOM ALONE.
TO BE HAPPY WE MUST NOT BE TOO CONCERNED WITH OTHERS.
STOP IT, YOU'RE MAKING ME BLUSH!
AWWW, I LOVE YOU TOO!
